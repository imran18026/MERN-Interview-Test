# M E R N Stack Drawing Application Frontend (Client)

This is the frontend of a M E R N stack drawing application built using React with Next.js App Router. It interacts with a backend server to manage and display drawing-related information, allowing users to create, view, update, and delete drawings.

## Setup Instructions

1. Dependencies: Ensure the node_modules folder is properly included in the project after installing dependencies using npm install or yarn.
2. Environment Variables: The project uses environment variables for database connection and other sensitive information. Ensure the .env.local file is placed in the root directory.

A sample .env.local.example file is provided in the root. It contains the exact same configuration as the .env.local file. Simply rename or copy .env.example to .env to configure the environment variables properly.

### Run the following command

```
yarn

yarn dev

```

## Client

Local: http://localhost:3000/

live: https://mern-drawing-client.vercel.app/

## Default Next js

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
